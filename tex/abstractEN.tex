A new application is being developed for teaching the BI-DBS subject at FIT CTU in Prague. The requirements for the application are derived from the existing application. This bachelor's thesis is focused on improving the development and maintenance processes of the new frontend for the web application based on analyses of the state of the existing application and the planned state. The main improvement points are adopting DevOps methodology and designing a new simplified and clear access management system. Conclusively, the main goal of the thesis is the implementation of authentication and authorization including restricting permissions, and automation of testing and deployment.
