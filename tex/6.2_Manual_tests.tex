\section{Manual testing} I have prepared a scenario for manual testing of all implemented features by the developers and also the group of users of the application. 

\paragraph*{Roles.} The test must be provided for each of the roles separately. \\
The roles are admin, guarantor, teacher, and student.

\paragraph*{Conditions.} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Client and Server applications are running.
    \item  Semester import was made, the user's username exists in the database and has at least one role for the imported course.
    \item  User must have access to the database of connections microservice to change the roles for tests.
    \item  The expiration time of the access token is mocked for 5 minutes.
\end{itemize}
