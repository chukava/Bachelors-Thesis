\section{Documentation} The last step from the DevOps practices adoption instruction is documentation for the team. I have written the documentation on the Redmine platform which is used for project management including the documentation. It contains all the sources with needed information, instruction of how to get access to the server and of course the file containing the first and the second sections of this chapter which have all the necessary information about the pipeline setup and used technologies.
