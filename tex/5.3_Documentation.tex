\section{Documentation} The last step from the DevOps practices adoption instruction is the documentation for the team. I have written the documentation shown in Figure \ref{doc} in the new documentation project created by Dana Suchomelov√°, which is used for frontend project documentation. It contains all the sources with needed information, instructions on how to get access to the server and of course the file containing the \ref{sec51} and \ref{sec52} sections of this chapter which have all the necessary information about the pipeline setup and used technologies.
