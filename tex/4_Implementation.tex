\chapter{Implementation}
Authentication is a process of identification and verification of the user's access to the application. Authorization is a process of granting or denying access to the application based on the authorized user's identity and the permissions for that identity. In this chapter, I will describe the implementation of those two processes for the client side along with the role-based access control, described in the third chapter.\\
My implementation uses the authentication microservice that was designed and described along with the general authorization flow for this service by Ing. Andrii Plyskach in his master thesis\cite{mt-plyskach}. For the purpose of reducing security vulnerabilities, I will also describe a few adjustments to the functionalities of that microservice.
