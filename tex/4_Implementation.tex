\chapter{Implementation}
Authentication is a process of identification and verification of the user's access to the application. Authorization is a process of granting or denying access to the application based on the authorized user's identity and the permissions for that identity. In this chapter, I will describe the implementation of those two processes for the client side with the use of role-based access control, described in the third chapter.\\
My implementation uses the authentication microservice that was designed and described along with the general communication flow for this service by Ing. Andrii Plyskach in his master thesis\cite{mt-plyskach}. For the purpose of reducing security vulnerabilities, I will describe a few adjustments to the functionalities of that microservice.



% Authentication and authorization

% Used technologies - Router, Pinia, Cookies

% OAuth protocol

% Flow, offered by Andrii and adjusted by me for 

% Tokens, JWT-Access, Refresh

% Tokens storage and security, cookies

% Example of validation accesses based on roles






% {Design and implementation of Authentication \& Authorization}

% The BI-DBS portal transfers to microservices architecture and gets \\  
%  modernized. In order to keep the application secure, a new identity and access management must be designed. In this chapter, I will describe the design for implementation of Authorization and Authorization, including the user roles and permissions management.
