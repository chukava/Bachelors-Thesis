\chapter{Analysis and design of the access control system} The BI-DBS portal uses role-based access control which is the way of granting access to the authorized user based on their role  that is associated with their identity.\\ %https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac#:~:text=Role%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(RBAC,assigning%20permissions%20to%20users%20individually
In this chapter I will describe the access control system designed for the new BI-DBS portal frontend, based on roles and permissions analysis. I will introduce existing roles, the main application modules and their components from the perspective of different roles. My goal is a making an access control system as clear as it is possible and provide an overview of the permissions for the roles.
