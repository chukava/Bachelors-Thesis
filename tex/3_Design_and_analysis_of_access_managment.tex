\chapter{Analysis and design of the access control system}\label{chap3} The BI-DBS portal uses role-based access control which is the way of granting access to the authorized user based on their role  that is associated with their identity. \cite{role-auth}\\ 
In this chapter I will describe the access control system designed for the new BI-DBS portal frontend, based on roles and permissions analysis. I will introduce existing roles, the main application modules and their components from the perspective of different roles. My goal is to make an access control system as clear as possible and provide an overview of the permissions for the roles.
