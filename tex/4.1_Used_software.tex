\section{Used software} The technologies used for the development of the BI-DBS portal are described in the the section 1.2. In this section I will mention which of them I have used for the implementation part in this thesis and also describe used libraries.\\
The UI is implemented in Vue.js together with the Quasar framework for creating good-looking components and typescript as a scripting language. 

\subsection{Pinia.} Pinia is a state management library which I used it in the implementation for storing the state of users's authorization along with the users's identity information like for example roles. For a reason that it is considered a secure storage.

\subsection{Router} Vue Router is a routing library, which provides mapping URLs to the components, which allows SPA to dynamicaly load pages based on the current URL. I have used it for managing accesses to the components based on the user's authentication state and identity. More about accesses in the section 4.3.

\subsection{Axios} Axios is a Javascript library for making HTTP requests from the browser of various request methods. It automatically transforms the response data to its response type and allows to intercept requests and responses. I have used it for communication with the backend.
