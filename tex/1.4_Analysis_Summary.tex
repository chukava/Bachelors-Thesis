\section{Summary and implications}

\subsection{Summary} 
In order to summarize all changes and provide a better visalization of them I arranged them all in a table 1.1.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|}
\textbf{}                                            & \textbf{Current state} & \textbf{Planned state} \\ \hline

\subsection{Implications} From the analysys in sections 1.2 and 1.3 we can see that problems existing in the current project are eliminated by chosen archchitecture and tehcnologies for the planned state. Let's examine the main possible negative effects of the changes and how to deal with them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Microservices architecture provide such advantages as agility and fast deployment. This architecture is more complex in compare with a monothic one. Therefore it comes along with establishing DevOps concepts for the project. Mainly configuring continuous integration and automated deployment. DevOps concepts and configuration of CI and CD are described in the second chapter.
    \item In the current application Nette is a core full-stack framework which is also responsible for managing the security of the application. Besides, monolithic architecture allows you to store all the data on the server-side. The communication between client-side and server-side is secure.\\
    In microservices application there is constant communication between the frontend and the backend and exchanging sensitive data. Therefore it is crucial to control every step of that communication with a control of permissions and validating inputs on both client and server sides. Thus the application should have clearly defined access management system which I will introduce in the third chapter.
\end{itemize}
