\chapter{Testing}\label{chapter6}I have provided two types of tests. First of them is unit tests, created specially for the CI pipeline, which tests the main functionalities like managing the data and processing of authentication and  authorization processes. Second type of tests is manual functional tests. I have created test scenarios for manuals testing of all the implemented features, including the cases for different roles.
