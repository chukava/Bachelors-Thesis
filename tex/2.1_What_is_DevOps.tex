\section{What is DevOps?} The term \textbf{DevOps} is derived from the combination of software \textbf{dev}elopment and IT \textbf{op}eration\textbf{s}.\\
DevOps is a relatively new term. Around 2007 and 2008 concerns about the separate work of software creators and software operators were raised. The concept started to grow on online forums and meet-ups. The first conference named "DevOps" was held in 2009. \cite{devops-wiki}\\
DevOps is a software development methodology composed of a set of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that improve an organization's ability to deliver applications, services, and improve products faster than traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. It represents a cultural shift that significantly affects a team that adopted that methodology and the software they make. \cite{devops-atl}
