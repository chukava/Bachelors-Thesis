\section{The BI-DBS portal}
The BI-DBS portal is a web application used for teaching database systems subject in a bachelor's study program at the Czech Technical University at the Faculty of Information Technology.

It allows managing and tracking all the student's studying progress during the semester, including semester tests, complex semester work, and exams. Besides, teachers have an overview of all their student's work in one application.\\
The current application was developed, as well as a new one being developed by students and teachers in subjects BI-SP1, BI-SP2 subjects, bachelor and master theses. That is a unique fact about this project. Every year, new students begin working on application development. They are open to sharing their ideas for improving the application.
