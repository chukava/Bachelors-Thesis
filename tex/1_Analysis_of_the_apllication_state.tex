\chapter{Analysis of the application state}
In this chapter, I will introduce an educational web application helping teach database systems subject at the university.
Furthermore, I will describe the current and planned state of the application from the perspective of software architectural patterns and the used core set of technologies with a focus on the frontend. The goal is to identify the existing problems of the current application, outline how they will be solved in a new portal, as well as indicate what difficulties we can face developing the new application using a new stack of technologies and new architecture.
